      "recommendation": "This `createElement` function is a classic example of a \"God function\" due to its many responsibilities: argument validation, key extraction, prop filtering, children processing, default prop application, and extensive development-only debugging setup. Breaking it down will significantly improve its maintainability and readability.\n\nThe core idea is to separate concerns like argument validation, configuration processing, children handling, default props, and dev-specific debugging into dedicated functions.\n\nHere's a suggested refactoring:\n\n**Split into:**\n\n1.  **`_validateCreateElementDevArgs(config, allArgs)`**\n    *   **What it does:** Handles all initial `__DEV__`-specific validations and warnings. This includes iterating through `arguments` to call `validateChildKeys` for each child and checking for the outdated JSX runtime transform warning based on `config.__self` and `config.key`.\n    *   *Initial logic:*\n        ```javascript\n        if (__DEV__) {\n          for (let i = 2; i < arguments.length; i++) {\n            validateChildKeys(arguments[i]);\n          }\n          if (\n            !didWarnAboutOldJSXRuntime &&\n            '__self' in config &&\n            !('key' in config)\n          ) {\n            didWarnAboutOldJSXRuntime = true;\n            console.warn(/* ... */);\n          }\n        }\n        ```\n\n2.  **`_extractKeyAndFilterProps(config, props)`**\n    *   **What it does:** Processes the `config` object to extract and format the `key` property (handling `REACT_OPTIMISTIC_KEY` and `checkKeyStringCoercion` in `__DEV__`). It then iterates through the `config` object, copying all properties *except* `key`, `__self`, and `__source` to the `props` object. This function returns the extracted `key`.\n    *   *Initial logic:*\n        ```javascript\n        let key = null;\n        // ... (config != null block)\n        if (hasValidKey(config)) { /* ... key extraction ... */ }\n        for (propName in config) {\n          if (\n            hasOwnProperty.call(config, propName) &&\n            propName !== 'key' &&\n            propName !== '__self' &&\n            propName !== '__source'\n          ) {\n            props[propName] = config[propName];\n          }\n        }\n        return key;\n        ```\n\n3.  **`_processChildrenArguments(props, allArgs, childrenStartIndex)`**\n    *   **What it does:** Takes the variadic `children` arguments (starting from `childrenStartIndex` in the `allArgs` array) and assigns them correctly to `props.children`. If there are multiple children, it creates an array and freezes it in `__DEV__`.\n    *   *Initial logic:*\n        ```javascript\n        const childrenLength = allArgs.length - childrenStartIndex;\n        if (childrenLength === 1) {\n          props.children = allArgs[childrenStartIndex];\n        } else if (childrenLength > 1) {\n          const childArray = Array(childrenLength);\n          for (let i = 0; i < childrenLength; i++) {\n            childArray[i] = allArgs[i + childrenStartIndex];\n          }\n          if (__DEV__ && Object.freeze) {\n            Object.freeze(childArray);\n          }\n          props.children = childArray;\n        }\n        ```\n\n4.  **`_applyDefaultProps(type, props)`**\n    *   **What it does:** Checks if the provided `type` has `defaultProps` and applies them to the `props` object for any properties that are currently `undefined`.\n    *   *Initial logic:*\n        ```javascript\n        if (type && type.defaultProps) {\n          const defaultProps = type.defaultProps;\n          for (propName in defaultProps) {\n            if (props[propName] === undefined) {\n              props[propName] = defaultProps[propName];\n            }\n          }\n        }\n        ```\n\n5.  **`_prepareDevDebugInfo(type, key, props)`**\n    *   **What it does:** Encapsulates all `__DEV__`-specific logic related to creating debug stacks and owner tracking for components. This includes setting up `debugStackDEV`, `debugTaskDEV`, and defining the `key` prop warning getter. It would return an object containing `debugStackDEV` and `debugTaskDEV`.\n    *   *Initial logic:*\n        ```javascript\n        let debugStackDEV = false;\n        let debugTaskDEV = false; // Renamed from its original conditional assignment\n        if (__DEV__) {\n          if (key) {\n            // ... defineKeyPropWarningGetter ...\n          }\n          const trackActualOwner = /* ... */;\n          if (trackActualOwner) {\n            // ... Error.stackTraceLimit manipulation ...\n            debugStackDEV = Error('react-stack-top-frame');\n            debugTaskDEV = createTask(getTaskName(type));\n          } else {\n            debugStackDEV = unknownOwnerDebugStack;\n            debugTaskDEV = unknownOwnerDebugTask;\n          }\n        }\n        return { debugStack: debugStackDEV, debugTask: debugTaskDEV };\n        ```\n\n**Refactored `createElement` (Orchestrator):**\n\n```javascript\nexport function createElement(type, config, children) {\n  const allArgs = arguments; // Capture arguments for functions that need them\n\n  // 1. Initial __DEV__ checks\n  if (__DEV__) {\n    _validateCreateElementDevArgs(config, allArgs);\n  }\n\n  const props = {};\n  let key = null;\n\n  // 2. Process config: extract key, filter props\n  if (config != null) {\n    key = _extractKeyAndFilterProps(config, props);\n  }\n\n  // 3. Process children arguments (children start at index 2)\n  _processChildrenArguments(props, allArgs, 2);\n\n  // 4. Apply defaultProps\n  _applyDefaultProps(type, props);\n\n  let debugStackDEV = false;\n  let debugTaskDEV = false; // Initialize for non-dev environments\n\n  // 5. Setup __DEV__ debug information\n  if (__DEV__) {\n    const devDebugInfo = _prepareDevDebugInfo(type, key, props);\n    debugStackDEV = devDebugInfo.debugStack;\n    debugTaskDEV = devDebugInfo.debugTask;\n  }\n\n  // Final ReactElement creation\n  return ReactElement(\n    type,\n    key,\n    props,\n    getOwner(),\n    debugStackDEV,\n    debugTaskDEV, // Pass the prepared debugTaskDEV\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n*   **Improved Readability and Understanding:** The main `createElement` function now acts as a high-level orchestrator, clearly outlining the steps involved in creating an element. Each helper function has a single, well-defined responsibility, making it easier to understand its purpose at a glance without getting lost in implementation details.\n*   **Reduced Cyclomatic Complexity:** By breaking the function into smaller units, the complexity of the original `createElement` function will drastically decrease, making it easier to reason about, test, and maintain.\n*   **Easier Testing:** Each new, smaller function can be unit-tested in isolation. For example, `_extractKeyAndFilterProps` can be tested with various `config` inputs to ensure correct key extraction and prop filtering without needing to mock the entire `ReactElement` creation process.\n*   **Clearer Separation of Concerns:** Development-only logic (warnings, debug stacks) is explicitly separated into `_validateCreateElementDevArgs` and `_prepareDevDebugInfo`, making the core production logic cleaner and easier to follow.\n*   **Better Maintainability:** Changes or bug fixes related to specific aspects (e.g., how children are handled, how keys are processed, or how dev warnings are emitted) can be localized to their respective functions without impacting other parts of the `createElement` process.\n*   **Reduced Cognitive Load:** Developers don't have to keep the entire complex logic of `createElement` in their heads simultaneously. They can focus on understanding one small, specific task performed by a helper function."

      "recommendation": "**Split into:**\n\n1.  **`validateJsxChildren(children, isStaticChildren)`** - Validates the children prop structure for development mode. This includes checking if static children are arrays, iterating to validate individual child keys, and freezing static children arrays.\n2.  **`warnAboutSpreadKey(type, config)`** - Checks if the `key` prop was spread into JSX (`{...propsWithKey}`) and logs a detailed warning if it was. It uses `didWarnAboutKeySpread` to ensure the warning is shown only once per component/example.\n3.  **`resolveElementKey(maybeKey, config)`** - Determines the final `key` value for the React element. It prioritizes the explicitly passed `maybeKey` from the compiler, then considers `config.key` (potentially from spread props), handling `REACT_OPTIMISTIC_KEY` and ensuring string coercion for keys, all within `__DEV__`.\n4.  **`extractAndPrepareProps(config, resolvedKey, type)`** - Creates the final `props` object for the React element. It ensures that the `key` property (if present in `config`) is removed from the `props` object passed to the component, and if a `resolvedKey` exists, it sets up a development-mode warning getter for `props.key` to catch accidental access.\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n*   **Reduced Complexity:** Each new function will have a significantly lower cyclomatic complexity, making them easier to understand, test, and maintain. The main `jsxDEVImpl` function will become a high-level orchestrator.\n*   **Improved Readability:** The main `jsxDEVImpl` function will read like a clear sequence of steps (validate children, warn about keys, resolve key, prepare props, create element), instead of a large block of conditional logic.\n*   **Clearer Responsibilities:** Each function is responsible for one specific task, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle. This makes it easier to reason about what each piece of code does.\n*   **Easier Testing:** Smaller, focused functions are simpler to unit test in isolation, leading to more robust and reliable code.\n*   **Potential for Reuse:** While these functions are highly specific to JSX development utilities, isolating their logic could make it marginally easier to adapt or reuse parts if similar validation or key-handling logic were needed elsewhere in a `__DEV__` context."

      "recommendation": "Here's how the `cloneElement` function can be refactored into smaller, focused functions to reduce its complexity.\n\n**Split into:**\n\n1.  **`validateInputElement(element)`**\n    *   **What it does:** Checks if the `element` argument is `null` or `undefined` and throws an error if it is, ensuring a valid React element is provided.\n    *   **Benefit:** Isolates input validation logic, making the main function cleaner and separating error handling.\n\n2.  **`getInitialPropsAndMetadata(element)`**\n    *   **What it does:** Creates an initial `props` object by shallowly copying `element.props`, and extracts the base `key` and `owner` from the original `element`.\n    *   **Benefit:** Centralizes the initialization of core data structures for the new element, improving clarity and preparing the mutable state.\n\n3.  **`processConfigKeyAndOwner(config, currentKey, currentOwner)`**\n    *   **What it does:** Examines the `config` object to update the `key` and `owner` values. It handles logic related to `hasValidRef`, `hasValidKey`, `REACT_OPTIMISTIC_KEY`, and `checkKeyStringCoercion` (in `__DEV__` environments).\n    *   **Benefit:** Encapsulates the specific and conditional logic for overriding `key` and `owner` from the `config`, reducing branching in the main function.\n\n4.  **`mergeConfigPropertiesIntoProps(config, props)`**\n    *   **What it does:** Iterates through all properties in the `config` object, filtering out reserved names (`key`, `__self`, `__source`) and `undefined` `ref`, then merges the remaining properties into the provided `props` object.\n    *   **Benefit:** Isolates the `for...in` loop and its associated conditional logic for merging config properties, making this specific part of the mutation clear.\n\n5.  **`collectChildrenFromArguments(args)`**\n    *   **What it does:** Processes the variadic arguments passed to `cloneElement` (starting from the third argument) to form the `props.children` value. This handles cases for zero, one, or multiple children.\n    *   **Benefit:** Extracts the logic for normalizing children arguments, which often involves array creation and conditional assignments, into a dedicated, testable function.\n\n6.  **`constructClonedElement(elementType, key, props, owner, debugStack, debugTask)`**\n    *   **What it does:** Calls the internal `ReactElement` constructor with all the prepared parameters to create the final cloned element instance.\n    *   **Benefit:** Centralizes the element creation call, making it explicit and separating it from the logic that prepares its arguments.\n\n7.  **`runChildrenValidation(args)`**\n    *   **What it does:** Iterates through the children arguments (if any) and applies `validateChildKeys` to each one for post-creation validation.\n    *   **Benefit:** Clearly separates post-creation validation concerns from the element construction process.\n\n**Refactored `cloneElement` structure:**\n\n```javascript\n// Assume helper functions are defined in the same scope or imported\n// function validateInputElement(element) { /* ... */ }\n// function getInitialPropsAndMetadata(element) { /* ... */ }\n// function processConfigKeyAndOwner(config, currentKey, currentOwner) { /* ... */ }\n// function mergeConfigPropertiesIntoProps(config, props) { /* ... */ }\n// function collectChildrenFromArguments(args) { /* ... */ }\n// function constructClonedElement(elementType, key, props, owner, debugStack, debugTask) { /* ... */ }\n// function runChildrenValidation(args) { /* ... */ }\n\nexport function cloneElement(element, config, children) {\n  validateInputElement(element); // 1.
