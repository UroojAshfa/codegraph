      "recommendation": "This `send` function is a classic example of accumulated complexity over time, handling many cross-cutting concerns (content negotiation, caching, specific status code behaviors, buffer management).\n\nHere's how we can refactor it into smaller, more focused functions:\n\n**Split into:**\n\n1.  **`_preprocessBodyAndSetContentType(body)`**\n    *   **What it does:** Handles the initial interpretation of the `body` (`chunk`). Sets default `Content-Type` headers for strings (defaults to HTML), `null` values, and binary views (`ArrayBuffer.isView`). Delegates to `this.json()` for other complex objects, potentially exiting early if `json()` handles the response. For strings, it also determines `utf8` encoding and updates the `Content-Type` header to reflect the charset.\n    *   **Original Code Sections:** The entire `switch (typeof chunk)` block, and the subsequent `if (typeof chunk === 'string') { encoding = 'utf8'; ... }` block.\n\n2.  **`_determineContentLengthAndEtagFlags(chunk, encoding)`**\n    *   **What it does:** Calculates the `Content-Length` of the body, potentially converting the `chunk` into a `Buffer` for accurate length determination if it's a string or other non-Buffer type. It also determines if an ETag *should* be generated based on existing `ETag` headers and the application's `etag fn` setting. The `Content-Length` header is set here.\n    *   **Original Code Sections:** `var etagFn = app.get('etag fn')` and `var generateETag = ...`, and the entire `if (chunk !== undefined) { ... this.set('Content-Length', len); }` block.\n\n3.  **`_generateAndSetEtag(chunk, encoding, len, generateETag)`**\n    *   **What it does:** If ETag generation is enabled (`generateETag` is true) and a content length (`len`) is available, this function uses the application's configured ETag function (`app.get('etag fn')`) to generate and set the `ETag` header on the response.\n    *   **Original Code Sections:** `var etag; if (generateETag && len !== undefined) { ... this.set('ETag', etag); }`\n\n4.  **`_handleFreshnessCheck(req)`**\n    *   **What it does:** Evaluates the request's freshness (e.g., via `If-None-Match`, `If-Modified-Since` headers). If the request is considered fresh, it sets the response status code to `304 Not Modified`.\n    *   **Original Code Sections:** `if (req.fresh) this.status(304);`\n\n5.  **`_adjustHeadersForStatus(chunk)`**\n    *   **What it does:** Modifies or removes specific response headers (`Content-Type`, `Content-Length`, `Transfer-Encoding`) and clears the response body (`chunk = ''`) when the status code is `204 No Content`, `304 Not Modified`, or `205 Reset Content`.\n    *   **Original Code Sections:** `if (204 === this.statusCode || 304 === this.statusCode) { ... }` and `if (this.statusCode === 205) { ... }`\n\n6.  **`_finalizeResponse(req, chunk, encoding)`**\n    *   **What it does:** Performs the ultimate sending of the response by calling `this.end()`. It specifically handles `HEAD` requests by sending an empty body (`this.end()`) to avoid sending actual content.\n    *   **Original Code Sections:** `if (req.method === 'HEAD') { ... } else { ... }`\n\n*(Note: These new functions would typically be private methods of the `res` object, meaning they can access `this` for properties like `this.app`, `this.req`, `this.statusCode`, and other methods like `this.get`, `this.set`, `this.type`, `this.removeHeader`, `this.status`, `this.end`, `this.json`.)*\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n*   **Improved Readability:** The main `send` function becomes a concise orchestration of clearly named steps, making its overall flow much easier to understand at a glance.\n*   **Reduced Cyclomatic Complexity:** Each new function will have a significantly lower cyclomatic complexity than the original 20, as they each focus on a single, well-defined decision path or operation.\n*   **Enhanced Maintainability:** Changes or bug fixes related to, for example, ETag generation, content-length calculation, or specific status code header adjustments, are isolated to their respective functions, reducing the risk of introducing regressions elsewhere.\n*   **Easier Testing:** Each individual function can be tested in isolation with specific inputs and expected outputs or side effects, leading to more robust and reliable code.\n*   **Clearer Responsibilities:** Each function has a single, well-defined purpose, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle. This makes the codebase easier to reason about and evolve."

      "recommendation": "This function currently has a high cyclomatic complexity (14), primarily due to the numerous event handlers defined as nested functions, multiple `if` conditions, and the shared `done` state management. By extracting these concerns into smaller, focused functions, we can significantly reduce the complexity of `sendfile` and improve its readability and maintainability.\n\n**Split into:**\n\n1.  **`createCompletionManager(callback)`:**\n    *   **What it does:** This utility function creates and returns an object containing two functions: `complete(err)` and `isDone()`. `complete(err)` acts as a wrapper for the original `callback`, ensuring it is called at most once, and manages an internal `done` state. `isDone()` allows other parts of the system to check if the operation has already completed without triggering a completion callback.\n    *   **Usage:** Replaces the `done` variable and its repetitive checks throughout the original function, centralizing state management for completion.\n\n2.  **`attachCoreFileListeners(file, complete, setStreamingState)`:**\n    *   **What it does:** Registers the primary event listeners directly on the `file` object (`directory`, `end`, `error`, `file`, `stream`).\n    *   It uses the `complete` function (from `createCompletionManager`) for error and successful termination signals (`directory`, `end`, `error`).\n    *   It uses a `setStreamingState` callback (provided by `sendfile`) to update the `streaming` flag, which indicates whether the file is currently being streamed.\n\n3.  **`attachResponseFinishListener(res, complete, isDone, getStreamingState, handleAborted)`:**\n    *   **What it does:** Encapsulates the most complex part of the original function: the `onFinished(res, ...)` logic. This includes handling specific `ECONNRESET` errors, general errors, and the crucial `setImmediate` check to detect potentially aborted requests when streaming hasn't concluded.\n    *   It utilizes the `complete` function for final operation completion, `isDone` to check if completion has already occurred, `getStreamingState` to query the current streaming status, and `handleAborted` for specific aborted error scenarios.\n\n4.  **`attachConditionalHeadersListener(file, options, res)`:**\n    *   **What it does:** This function conditionally attaches a `file.on('headers', ...)` listener. It only does so if `options.headers` are provided. The attached listener iterates through the specified headers and sets them on the response object (`res`).\n    *   **Usage:** Isolates the header-setting concern, which is an optional feature.\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n*   **Reduced Cyclomatic Complexity:** The primary `sendfile` function will have significantly fewer `if` statements and nested functions, drastically lowering its complexity metric and making it much easier to reason about.\n*   **Improved Readability and Clarity:** The main function will become a concise sequence of high-level steps (e.g., \"manage completion,\" \"set up file events,\" \"handle response finish,\" \"apply headers\"), clearly outlining the flow without getting bogged down in implementation details.\n*   **Enhanced Maintainability:** Each new function focuses on a single responsibility. Changes or bug fixes related to specific aspects (e.g., how the response finishes, how headers are applied, or how file errors are handled) can be made in isolation, reducing the risk of introducing regressions elsewhere.\n*   **Increased Testability:** Smaller, more focused functions are inherently easier to write unit tests for. This leads to more robust and reliable code.\n*   **Better Separation of Concerns:** Distinct responsibilities like managing completion, handling file events, responding to `onFinished`, and setting headers are clearly separated into their own modules/functions, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle."

      "recommendation": "The `res.sendFile` function currently handles several distinct responsibilities: argument validation and normalization, file stream configuration, and final transfer with error handling. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle and contributes to its high cyclomatic complexity.\n\nHere's how we can refactor it into smaller, more focused functions:\n\n**Split into:**\n1.  `_parseAndValidateSendFileArgs(path, options, callback)` - This function would encapsulate all argument validation and normalization logic. It checks for `path` existence and type, handles `options` being passed as a callback, and validates the absolute path/root requirement. It returns an object containing the resolved `path`, `opts`, and `done` callback.\n2.  `_configureAndCreateFileStream(req, path, opts)` - This function sets up the file stream for transfer. It's responsible for encoding the URI of the path, wiring the application's `etag` setting into the `opts`, and calling the underlying `send` utility to create the file object.\n3.  `_handleSendFileTransferCompletion(err, done, next)` - This function centralizes the logic for handling the callback from the `sendfile` utility. It decides whether to invoke the user-provided `done` callback, call `next()` for directory errors (`EISDIR`), or propagate other non-write errors to `next(err)`.\n\n**Refactored `res.sendFile` structure:**\n\n```javascript\n// These helper functions would typically be private methods on the `res` object\n// or closure-scoped helpers accessible within the module.\n// For demonstration, let's assume they are methods on `res`'s prototype or within its scope.\n\n// 1. Helper function for argument parsing and validation\nfunction _parseAndValidateSendFileArgs(path, options, callback) {\n  var done = callback;\n  var opts = options || {};\n\n  if (!path) {\n    throw new TypeError('path argument is required to res.sendFile');\n  }\n\n  if (typeof path !== 'string') {\n    throw new TypeError('path must be a string to res.sendFile');\n  }\n\n  // support function as second arg\n  if (typeof options === 'function') {\n    done = options;\n    opts = {}; // Reset opts as options was the callback\n  }\n\n  if (!opts.root && !pathIsAbsolute(path)) { // Assuming pathIsAbsolute is accessible\n    throw new TypeError('path must be absolute or specify root to res.sendFile');\n  }\n\n  return { path: path, opts: opts, done: done };\n}\n\n// 2. Helper function for configuring and creating the file stream\nfunction _configureAndCreateFileStream(req, path, opts) {\n  // 'this' would refer to 'res' if this is a method on res\n  opts.etag = this.app.enabled('etag');\n  var pathname = encodeURI(path);\n  return send(req, pathname, opts); // Assuming 'send' utility is accessible\n}\n\n// 3. Helper function for handling the sendfile completion callback\nfunction _handleSendFileTransferCompletion(err, done, next) {\n  if (done) return done(err);\n  if (err && err.code === 'EISDIR') return next();\n\n  // next() all but write errors\n  if (err && err.code !== 'ECONNABORTED' && err.syscall !== 'write') {\n    next(err);\n  }\n}\n\n// The refactored main function\nres.sendFile = function sendFile(path, options, callback) {\n  var req = this.req;\n  var res = this; // 'this' context is 'res'\n  var next = req.next;\n\n  // Step 1: Parse and validate arguments\n  var { path: validatedPath, opts: preparedOpts, done: finalDone } = _parseAndValidateSendFileArgs.call(res, path, options, callback);\n\n  // Step 2: Configure and create the file stream\n  var file = _configureAndCreateFileStream.call(res, req, validatedPath, preparedOpts);\n\n  // Step 3: Initiate transfer and handle completion\n  sendfile(res, file, preparedOpts, function (err) { // Assuming 'sendfile' utility is accessible\n    _handleSendFileTransferCompletion(err, finalDone, next);\n  });\n};\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n*   **Reduced Complexity:** The main `res.sendFile` function now has a significantly lower cyclomatic complexity, as it primarily orchestrates calls to smaller, focused helper functions. Each helper function manages its own internal complexity.\n*   **Improved Readability and Maintainability:** Each new function has a single, clear responsibility, making the code easier to read, understand, and reason about. Developers can focus on one specific aspect (validation, stream setup, or error handling) without being distracted by others.\n*   **Easier Testing:** Each individual helper function can be tested in isolation with specific inputs, making it much simpler to ensure correctness for validation rules, stream configuration, and error handling logic.\n*   **Clear Separation of Concerns:** The refactoring clearly separates the concerns of argument handling, file stream preparation, and transfer post-processing, aligning the code structure with its logical responsibilities."

By breaking it down, we can make each new function responsible for a single, well-defined task.\n\nHere's how to refactor it into smaller, focused functions:\n\n**Split into:**\n1.  **`_getJsonpSettings(app)`** - Retrieves all necessary JSON serialization (replacer, spaces, escape) and JSONP callback name key settings from the application's configuration.\n2.  **`_resolveJsonpCallback(req, callbackNameKey)`** - Extracts the potential JSONP callback name from the request's query parameters, handling array values by taking the first one if present.\n3.  **`_stringifyJsonObject(obj, replacer, spaces, escape)`** - Converts the given JavaScript object `obj` into a JSON string using the specified `replacer`, `spaces`, and `escape` options. (This effectively wraps the external `stringify` function within the refactored module's context).\n4.  **`_formatJsonpBody(jsonString, callback)`** - Transforms a JSON string into a JSONP response string. This involves sanitizing the `callback` name, escaping specific Unicode characters (`\\u2028`, `\\u2029`) in the `jsonString`, and wrapping it with the JSONP security prefix and function call.\n5.  **`_setDefaultJsonHeaders(res)`** - Sets the default `application/json` Content-Type and `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header on the response object, but only if a Content-Type has not already been explicitly set.\n6.  **`_overrideJsonpHeaders(res)`** - Sets the `text/javascript` Content-Type and `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header on the response object, specifically for JSONP responses.\n\n**Refactored `jsonp` function:**\n\n```javascript\n// Assuming stringify is available in scope or imported, e.g., from a utility module.\n// For example: const stringify = require('./utils/stringify');\n\n// Helper functions (could be defined as private methods on `res` or in a utility module)\nfunction _getJsonpSettings(app) {\n  return {\n    escape: app.get('json escape'),\n    replacer: app.get('json replacer'),\n    spaces: app.get('json spaces'),\n    callbackNameKey: app.get('jsonp callback name')\n  };\n}\n\nfunction _resolveJsonpCallback(req, callbackNameKey) {\n  let callback = req.query[callbackNameKey];\n  if (Array.isArray(callback)) {\n    callback = callback[0];\n  }\n  return callback;\n}\n\nfunction _stringifyJsonObject(obj, replacer, spaces, escape) {\n  // Assuming 'stringify' is available in the current scope or imported\n  // For Express-like environments, this might be JSON.stringify with custom escaping applied.\n  return stringify(obj, replacer, spaces, escape);\n}\n\nfunction _formatJsonpBody(jsonString, callback) {\n  // restrict callback charset\n  callback = callback.replace(/[^\\[\\]\\w$.]/g, '');\n\n  if (jsonString === undefined) {\n    jsonString = '';\n  } else if (typeof jsonString === 'string') {\n    // replace chars not allowed in JavaScript that are in JSON\n    jsonString = jsonString\n      .replace(/\\u2028/g, '\\\\u2028')\n      .replace(/\\u2029/g, '\\\\u2029');\n  }\n\n  // the /**/ is a specific security mitigation for \"Rosetta Flash JSONP abuse\"\n  // the typeof check is just to reduce client error noise\n  return '/**/ typeof ' + callback + ' === \\'function\\' && ' + callback + '(' + jsonString + ');';\n}\n\nfunction _setDefaultJsonHeaders(res) {\n  if (!res.get('Content-Type')) {\n    res.set('X-Content-Type-Options', 'nosniff');\n    res.set('Content-Type', 'application/json');\n  }\n}\n\nfunction _overrideJsonpHeaders(res) {\n  res.set('X-Content-Type-Options', 'nosniff');\n  res.set('Content-Type', 'text/javascript');\n}\n\n// The refactored main function\nres.jsonp = function jsonp(obj) {\n  const config = _getJsonpSettings(this.app);\n  let body = _stringifyJsonObject(obj, config.replacer, config.spaces, config.escape);\n  const callback = _resolveJsonpCallback(this.req, config.callbackNameKey);\n\n  // Set default JSON headers if not already set\n  _setDefaultJsonHeaders(this);\n\n  // If a valid JSONP callback is present, format the body and override headers\n  if (typeof callback === 'string' && callback.length !== 0) {\n    _overrideJsonpHeaders(this);\n    body = _formatJsonpBody(body, callback);\n  }\n\n  return this.send(body);\n};\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n*   **Reduced Complexity:** The main `jsonp` function's cyclomatic complexity is drastically reduced (from 12 to approximately 4), making it much easier to read, understand, and test.

For example, `_formatJsonpBody` can be tested with various `body` and `callback` inputs without needing a full `res` or `req` object.\n*   **Better Maintainability:** Changes to how settings are retrieved, how callbacks are resolved, or how headers are set can be made in their respective functions without impacting other parts of the logic.\n*   **Potential for Reusability:** Some helper functions, like `_getJsonpSettings` or `_setDefaultJsonHeaders`, might be reusable by other response-handling functions if similar logic is needed elsewhere."

It handles the overloaded function signatures.\n    *   **Input:** `filename`, `options`, `callback` (the original arguments passed to `res.download`, excluding `path`).\n    *   **Output:** An object `{ name: string | null, opts: object | null, done: Function | null }`.\n\n2.  `buildContentDispositionHeaders(name, path, options)` - This function is responsible for creating the initial `Content-Disposition` header based on the determined `name` or original `path`. It then merges any user-provided custom headers from `options`, ensuring that the `Content-Disposition` header isn't accidentally overwritten.\n    *   **Input:** `name` (the normalized filename), `path` (the original path), `opts` (the normalized options object).\n    *   **Output:** A `headers` object, e.g., `{ 'Content-Disposition': 'attachment; filename=\"file.txt\"', 'Custom-Header': 'value' }`.\n\n3.  `prepareSendFileOptions(options, headers)` - This function takes the normalized `options` and the carefully constructed `headers` object, creating the final options object structure that `this.sendFile` expects. It ensures that a new options object is created (to avoid side effects) and the headers are correctly integrated.\n    *   **Input:** `opts` (the normalized options), `headers` (the prepared headers).\n    *   **Output:** A new `opts` object ready for `this.sendFile`, e.g., `{ headers: { ... }, root: '...' }`.\n\n**Refactored `download` function:**\n\n```javascript\n// Assuming contentDisposition and resolve are available in scope\n// e.g., imported at the top of the module:\n// const contentDisposition = require('content-disposition');\n// const resolve = require('path').resolve;\n\n\n// Helper function 1: Normalizes arguments for download\nfunction normalizeDownloadArguments(filename, options, callback) {\n  let done = callback;\n  let name = filename;\n  let opts = options || null;\n\n  // support function as second or third arg\n  if (typeof filename === 'function') {\n    done = filename;\n    name = null;\n    opts = null;\n  } else if (typeof options === 'function') {\n    done = options;\n    opts = null;\n  }\n\n  // support optional filename, where options may be in its place\n  if (typeof filename === 'object' && (typeof options === 'function' || options === undefined)) {\n    name = null;\n    opts = filename;\n  }\n\n  return { name, opts, done };\n}\n\n// Helper function 2: Builds content disposition and merges custom headers\nfunction buildContentDispositionHeaders(name, path, opts) {\n  const headers = {\n    'Content-Disposition': contentDisposition(name || path)\n  };\n\n  if (opts && opts.headers) {\n    const keys = Object.keys(opts.headers);\n    for (let i = 0; i < keys.length; i++) {\n      const key = keys[i];\n      if (key.toLowerCase() !== 'content-disposition') {\n        headers[key] = opts.headers[key];\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  return headers;\n}\n\n// Helper function 3: Prepares the final options object for sendFile\nfunction prepareSendFileOptions(opts, headers) {\n  // Merge user-provided options by creating a new object\n  const sendFileOpts = Object.create(opts || null); // Ensure opts is an object, even if null initially\n  sendFileOpts.headers = headers;\n  return sendFileOpts;\n}\n\n\n// The refactored main download function\nres.download = function download(path, filename, options, callback) {\n  // 1.

The argument normalization logic, which previously caused significant branching, is now isolated within `normalizeDownloadArguments`, making the main function much simpler and easier to reason about.\n*   **Easier Testing:** Each smaller function can be tested in isolation. You can unit test `normalizeDownloadArguments` with various argument permutations, `buildContentDispositionHeaders` with different header inputs, and `prepareSendFileOptions` with different option structures, without needing to mock `this.sendFile`.\n*   **Better Maintainability:** Changes to how arguments are parsed (e.g., adding another signature) only affect `normalizeDownloadArguments`. Similarly, changes to header logic affect only `buildContentDispositionHeaders`. This modularity reduces the risk of introducing bugs in unrelated parts of the code.\n*   **Clearer Single Responsibility:** Each new function now adheres more closely to the Single Responsibility Principle, focusing on one specific task (parsing, header creation, option structuring)."

Fixing this is a high priority for long-term maintainability and team productivity, especially if the function is frequently modified or is central to critical business logic."
      ],
      "recommendation": "The high complexity (9) in `app.use` stems from its multiple responsibilities: parsing arguments, flattening middleware, validating input, and conditionally handling two distinct types of middleware (simple functions vs. full Express apps).\n\nHere's a refactoring suggestion:\n\n**Split into:**\n1.  **`determineUseArgs(rawArgs)`** - Parses the initial arguments (`arguments` object) to determine if the first effective argument is a path string or the first middleware function. It handles the specific logic for `app.use(path, fn...)` vs `app.use(fn...)` and also the `app.use([fn])` edge case, returning the determined path and the offset for subsequent middleware.\n2.  **`getFlattenedMiddlewareFunctions(rawArgs, offset)`** - Takes the raw `arguments` object and the calculated `offset`, then flattens all subsequent arguments into a single array of middleware functions using the existing `flatten` utility.\n3.  **`ensureMiddlewareProvided(fns)`** - Validates that at least one middleware function is present in the provided array. If not, it throws a `TypeError`.\n4.  **`registerOrMountMiddleware(middleware, path, router, appInstance)`** - This function acts as a dispatcher. It checks if the given `middleware` is an Express app (by checking for `handle` and `set` properties). Based on this, it either calls `mountSubApp` or `registerSimpleMiddleware`.\n5.  **`registerSimpleMiddleware(middleware, path, router)`** - Registers a standard middleware function directly with the internal router. This handles the case where the middleware is not an Express sub-application.\n6.  **`mountSubApp(subApp, path, router, parentApp)`** - Configures and registers another Express application (`subApp`) as a mounted sub-application. This includes setting `mountpath` and `parent`, creating the wrapper middleware to restore `req.app` and `res.app` context, registering this wrapper with the router, and emitting the 'mount' event.\n\n**Refactored `app.use` (conceptual):**\n```javascript\napp.use = function use(fn) {\n  const [path, offset] = determineUseArgs(arguments);\n  const fns = getFlattenedMiddlewareFunctions(arguments, offset);\n  ensureMiddlewareProvided(fns);\n\n  const router = this.router;\n\n  fns.forEach(function (middleware) {\n    registerOrMountMiddleware(middleware, path, router, this); // 'this' refers to the current app instance\n  }, this);\n\n  return this;\n};\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n*   **Improved Readability:** The main `app.use` function becomes a high-level orchestration, outlining the steps clearly. Each smaller function has a single, well-defined responsibility, making the code easier to understand at a glance.\n*   **Reduced Complexity:** The original function's cyclomatic complexity (9) is distributed across multiple, simpler functions. Each new function will have a lower individual complexity, making them easier to reason about, test, and maintain.\n*   **Easier Testing:** Each new function can be tested in isolation with specific inputs, without needing to set up the entire `app.use` context. For example, `determineUseArgs` can be tested with various argument patterns, and `mountSubApp` can be tested to ensure correct property setting and event emission.\n*   **Better Maintainability:** Changes or bug fixes related to specific aspects (e.g., how arguments are parsed, how sub-apps are mounted) would be isolated to their respective functions, reducing the risk of introducing regressions elsewhere in the `app.use` logic.\n*   **Clearer Internal API:** By giving names to these distinct internal steps, it creates a clearer understanding of how `app.use` operates, which can be beneficial for future development and onboarding new contributors to the codebase."
